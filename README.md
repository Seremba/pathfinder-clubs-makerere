# pathfinder-clubs-makerere
Makerere Pathfinder Clubs is a place where pathfinders register their clubs and add events. You can add, delete, and update your Pathfinder club.
Soon we will add the ability to add a map so it is easy to locate the club on a map. The application is developed with Thymleaf template engine, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Hibernate and SQL database.
